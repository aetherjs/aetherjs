### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Name's Vlad. I am a self-learning (I learn fast though) fullstack web developer. I graduated UCL with MSc in computer science in 2021, and been exploring the space ever since. 

Even before university, I had experience with programming. Starting off with competitive programming in school left me with a foundation to build upon in low-level languages like C and C++. 

Uni projects taught me Java, Kotlin (I _really_ prefer the latter) and Python well. More specifically, I have good experience with OOP development, various build/CI/CD systems, I understand JVM well and I can write good code. I have used python in diverse environments and use cases, for standalone apps and scripts, for making simple web APIs, and most importantly I worked quite a lot with python notebooks, for data analysis, mining in retrieval tasks. Frameworks like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, stuff like that. 

Lately (in the past 3 years as time flies fast) I've been working all across the spectrum of modern web development - starting from frontend (JS/TS, React stack with some experiments in Vue and Svelte), complimenting it with backend development as well using Node.js, building serverless backends on Azure handling millions requests per day.

I have plenty of experience in collaborative software development, and have a soft spot for nice products, clean solutions and analytics. 

Fluent English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, with some German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on the side (more German in the making!)

P.S. Most of my recent work is sadly either in private or on GitLab
