### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Name's Vlad, I'm a product-minded fullstack developer with both startup and enterprise experience. Skilled in modern web development and emerging tech - having built web3 products and genAI apps.

Even before university, I had experience with programming. Starting off with competitive programming in school left me with a foundation to build upon in low-level languages like C and C++. 

Having done my Bachelors and Masters at UCL, I've digged into a variety of software disciplines, including cryptography, low-level programming, machine learning and more specifically NLP (the thing people used to do before large language models) and information retrieval. We've made numerous group projects, including building a prototype accessibility app interning at @microsoft. My spell in university was rounded off with a research internship @jetbrains, leading to a distinction-graded master thesis.

Lately (in the past 3 years as time flies fast) I've been working all across the spectrum of modern web development - starting from frontend (JS/TS, React stack with some experiments in Vue and Svelte), complimenting it with backend development as well using Node.js, building serverless backends on Azure handling millions requests per day.

I have plenty of experience in collaborative software development, and have a soft spot for nice products, clean solutions and analytics. 

Fluent English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, with some German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on the side (more German in the making!)

P.S. Most of my recent work is sadly in private, but I'm trying to cut more time for pet projects and fun stuff
