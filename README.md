### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

Name's Vlad, I'm a product-minded fullstack developer with both startup and enterprise experience. Skilled in modern web development and emerging tech - having built web3 products and genAI apps.

Even before university, I had experience with programming. Starting off with competitive programming in school left me with a foundation to build upon in low-level languages like C and C++. 

Having done my Bachelors and Masters at UCL, I've digged into a variety of software disciplines, including cryptography, low-level programming, machine learning and more specifically NLP (the thing people used to do before large language models) and information retrieval. We've made numerous group projects, including building a prototype accessibility app interning at @microsoft. My spell in university was rounded off with a research internship @jetbrains, leading to a distinction-graded master thesis.

My initial experience with web development came in form of a dynamic startup project in the web3 space, building a gamified, analytics enabled platform helping users showcase their reputation and identity on chain. Despite challenging timing (DeFi summer of 2021 finally running to an end, extremely fast market slowdown) we managed to grow our project to over $100,000 in revenues in a small team of three before finally moving on.

Lately (in the past 2 years as time flies fast) I've been working all across the spectrum of modern web development - starting from frontend (JS/TS, React stack with some experiments in Vue and Svelte), complimenting it with backend development as well using Node.js, building serverless backends on Azure handling millions requests per day. I have built experience accross different sectors, ranging from clinical studies infrastructure dealing with sensible data to large commercial retail systems and insurance. 

Currently working on an exciting internal GenAI product.

Fluent English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ and French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·, with some German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on the side (more German in the making!)

P.S. Most of my recent work is sadly in private, but I'm trying to cut more time for pet projects and fun stuff
