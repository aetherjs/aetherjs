### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Name's Vlad. I am a self-learning (I learn fast though) solidity + web3 developer. I graduated UCL with MSc in computer science in 2021, and been exploring the space ever since. 

Even before university, I had experience with programming. Starting off with competitive programming in school left me with a foundation to build upon in low-level languages like C and C++. 

Uni projects taught me Java, Kotlin (I _really_ prefer the latter) and Python well. More specifically, I have good experience with OOP development, various build/CI/CD systems, I understand JVM well and I can write good code. I have used python in diverse environments and use cases, for standalone apps and scripts, for making simple web APIs, and most importantly I worked quite a lot with python notebooks, for data analysis, mining in retrieval tasks. Frameworks like pandas, numpy, tensorflow, stuff like that. 

Lately, I been working on the basic skillset necessary for DeFi development: teaching myself Solidity & EVM, along with JavaScript with all its blockchain dev toolset: hardhat, truffle, foundry, cast. To supplement this, I have started work on two separate DeFi projects which I'm afraid I cannot advertise yet (hopefully, soon though). I am also really keen to capitalize on my understanding on architecture and low-level programming to add Rust to my skillset as soon as possible.

I have plenty of experience in collaborative software development, and have a soft spot for nice products, clean solutions and analytics. 

Fluent English ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ with some French ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· and German ðŸ‡©ðŸ‡ª on the side.

P.S. Most of my recent work is either in private or on GitLab
